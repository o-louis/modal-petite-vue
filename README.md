# Modal-petite-vue

[petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) is an alternative distribution of Vue optimized for progressive enhancement. It is specifically optimized for "sprinkling" small amount of interactions on an existing HTML page rendered by a server framework.

I wanted to test it so I did a modal display when an user enter the correct password.

It almost looks like Vue so it is clear, simple and easy to get it.
